#### *Introduction* 
 This analysis was prompted by the availability of Queensland public dental wait list data on the government data portal. While not tied to a specific shift in government, policy review or crisis, routine examination of tax-funded service performance supports transparency, accountability, and informed public discourse. As someone without recent personal experience in the public dental system, this analysis also serves as an opportunity to understand how these services function in practice.
 
 ## The Challenge
 ### *Queensland public dental patients face varying wait times that may delay necessary care and indicate system inefficiencies.* This analysis examines wait list performance across clinics and catchments to identify where the system is succeeding or struggling to meet demand. Patients need timely care to protect their health, clinics need realistic targets to deliver quality service, and health departments need evidence to allocate resources effectively. By understanding patterns in treatment volumes and compliance with recommended timeframes, the analysis enables evidence-based decisions that prioritize patient health outcomes.

#### *What decisions might be influenced?*  
Findings can inform potential adjustments to resource allocation, clinic activities and scheduling to improve access to care and ensure patients are treated within recommended timeframes. Insights from the analysis may inform a reevaluation of appointment timeframes, particularly for appointment types where patients are consistently treated on time or earlier, to ensure targets remain realistic and achievable.  

#### *Measures that matter* 
+ General wait times for patients 
+ Treatment volume
+ Compliance rate % within recommended timeframes
+ Clinic performance across catchments
+ Percentage of patients treated relative to those waiting - highlighting treatment coverage per period- % treated vs waiting 
+ The volume under a temporal lens to understand patterns or cyclical behaviour - n. time analysis
+ Identifying periods which experience a waitlist growing or shrinking (and more are treated) - time analysis % treated vs waiting
+ Comparison of clinic and catchment performance to set a baseline and gauge degree of backlog   

  
The big question:
## How effectively are Queensland public dental clinics managing patient demand across services and catchments?

### Supporting Questions 

#### *System Trends:*  
How have waiting list volumes changed over time? Are there seasonal or cyclical patterns occuring - is that tied to recommended wait times?  
  
How consistent are waiting trends across different service areas (e.g., general vs. priority treatment)?  
  
Which clinics or catchments have the longest patient waiting times, and how does this vary over time?  
  
what services are growing in demand? over the years  
  
#### *Clinic & Catchment Comparison:*   
Which Catchments capture the most patients?
  
Which specific Catchments have the largest patient base (at a given time) and are visits seasonal?  
  
What is the average number of patients treated per clinic per period?  
  
Clinic's with the highest backlog relative to their output?  
  
How do clinics rank across catchements in meeting desired wait times and treatment targets?  
  
Given appointment type, what percentage of patients are treated within the recommended timeframe?   
  
#### *Service Availability:*   
How many clinics service a type of appointment? Are there appointment types under serviced/or oversubscribed?  
  
Which appointment types have the greatest lagg in terms of service?
