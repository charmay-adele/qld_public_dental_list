The Queensland Dental Waiting List data tracks patient movement in and out of waiting and treated status across participating clinics in different regions. As someone without recent personal experience in the public dental system, this analysis also serves as an opportunity to understand how these services function in practice.

 ### *Queensland public dental patients face varying wait times that may delay necessary care and indicate system inefficiencies.* This analysis examines wait list performance across clinics and catchments to identify where the system is succeeding or struggling to meet demand. Patients need timely care to protect their health, clinics need realistic targets to deliver quality service, and health departments need evidence to allocate resources effectively. By understanding patterns in treatment volumes and compliance with recommended timeframes, the analysis enables evidence-based decisions that prioritize patient health outcomes.
